## Caching the Inverse of a Matrix

## makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix" that can cache its inverse.
## It is really a list containing a function to
## set the value of the matrix
## get the value of the matrix
## set the value of the inverse
## get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    s <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        s <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setsolve <- function(solve) s <<- solve
    getsolve <- function() s
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setsolve = setsolve,
         getsolve = getsolve)
}

## cacheSolve computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned
## by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated
## (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve
## the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    s <- x$getsolve()
    if(!is.null(s)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(s)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    s <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setsolve(s)
    s
